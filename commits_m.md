## 2026-08-24 19:15 (+06) — Fixed two navigation dead ends on the Champion path

"My appeals" and "My orders" were bare `Scaffold`s reached with `context.go`,
which replaces the stack — so no back button rendered and neither screen has a
navigation bar, leaving no way off either one. The orders case is on the
purchase path, straight from the checkout receipt. Both now sit inside
`AppShell`, which supplies its "Back to home" affordance exactly when there is
nothing to pop. Also corrected the README's local-run command, whose
copy-pasteable block gave the Android-emulator address to every target.

Files: `views/appeals/appeals_view.dart`, `views/orders/buyer_orders_view.dart`,
`core/api_config.dart`, `services/server_warmup.dart`, `README.md`,
`test/core/api_config_test.dart` (new).

Checks: `flutter analyze` clean · `flutter test` 567 → **576**.

## 2026-08-24 18:40 (+06) — Greenpreneur sales report, and web fixes

Added a sales report for the 3ZERO Greenpreneur — order value, cash collected,
simulated payments and amounts still to collect, over today / 7 / 30 / 90 days
and all time — as a new `Sales` tab and a home card. Figures are deliberately
split rather than summed: nothing in this system ever pays a seller, and the
prototype online methods move no money, so a single "received" total would be
partly fictional. Also fixed a listing-editor save that reported success as
failure when the page had been refreshed, and gave the form keyboard navigation.

Files: `core/sales_report.dart`, `controllers/sales_report_controller.dart`,
`views/seller/seller_sales_view.dart` (new); `order_service.dart`,
`constants.dart`, `router.dart`, `app_shell.dart`, `home_view.dart`,
`product_edit_view.dart`, `order_card.dart`; two new test files.

Checks: `flutter analyze` clean · `flutter test` 525 → **567** ·
`flutter build web` succeeds.

## 2026-08-24 17:20 (+06) — UI/UX pass: layout, contrast, and dead ends

Fixed usability and correctness defects the suite did not cover: two layout
overflows that hit at the default text size, error snackbars rendered at 1.70:1
contrast, and dead ends in the scanner, checkout, the Greenpreneur destinations
and Android back. Remaining leads, and the five areas the audit did not reach,
are in `UX_AUDIT_OUTSTANDING.md`.

Files: 22 modified, 3 added (`views/shared/app_snackbar.dart`,
`views/shared/unsaved_changes.dart`, `test/ux_hardening_test.dart`).

Also fixed a `ListTile` assertion caught on device: the appeal evidence card
wrapped its `CheckboxListTile` in an opaque `DecoratedBox`, hiding the tile's ink
splashes, so the confirmation an admin must tick gave no press feedback.

Checks: `flutter analyze` clean · `flutter test` 496 → **525** ·
`flutter build web` succeeds.

## 2026-08-24 12:52 (+06) — Internal audit of `5b1b779`: fixed seven defects

Read the whole trust boundary — `server/src`, `firestore.rules`, `lib/` —
looking for defects rather than working against someone else's list. The payout
path was sound: nothing found could mint points, escalate privilege, or let a
client write a balance. The one finding with a user-visible consequence was the
weekly claim quota, which always displayed as unused because the client parsed a
wire key the server has never sent. Full write-up in `AUDIT_2026-08-24.md`.

Files: `lib/services/claim_service.dart`, `lib/core/product_taxonomy.dart`,
`lib/core/validators.dart`, `server/src/award.js`, four views
(`seller_products`, `product_detail`, `admin_appeals`, `appeal_form`),
`seller_application_view`, `rejection_reason_dialog`, `checkout_view`,
plus `AUDIT_2026-08-24.md` and three test files.

Checks: `flutter analyze` clean · `flutter test` 482 → **496** ·
`npm test --prefix server` 279 · `rules_test` 222 · `flutter build web` succeeds.
